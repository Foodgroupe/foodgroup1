            I wish I could give another star, seriously. My husband and I went there last night for our fourth wedding anniversary and the service and food were just outstanding. Since it was a special occasion, we ordered more than we probably would have otherwise. We got the summer bean salad with ricotta and cherry tomatoes and the duck liver pate (which was so creamy and amazing). We ran out of crostini crackers and our very nice waiter brought us more on request. Then, for dinner, I got homemade pasta with wild mushrooms and beans and my husband got the most amazing dish ever, lamb pot pie. Mine was great, very light, which is what I was looking for after being almost full from the starters, but HIS was just beyond description. It had fresh veggies, melt-in-your-mouth lamb, melted leeks and this buttery crust on top. We saved a bunch so we could eat it again later. We were very tempted by dessert, but just couldn't hack it

        Went here for dinner last week and it was a positive experience.

        It was quiet on a Wednesday night at 6:30, and still pretty quiet at 8 when I left. It's a nice, smallish menu with a good mix of dishes. There was a lot of stuff I was looking forward to trying!

        The cheese selections are solid (I tried two of their three). I had the pork chop entree which was, in my opinion, too big. They would do better to have a more thoughtful dish that's a smaller portion. The vegetables were fine but unremarkable, and the pork was good but could have been better (it was a nice and generous cut- I would have preferred smaller, maybe with an interesting sauce or something). One of the people I was with got the lamb pot pie which was great. Really good lamb, and just a very nice dish all around.

        Cocktails were a-ok (and strong which was appreciated). Wine list, as many others have remared, is nice and thoughtful.

        Only thing I'll say is, it seemed to me that the prices were a little high for the "specialness" of the dishes. They were solid, but could use a boost of some extra attention to justify the prices (lamb pot pie excluded- that was really on point).
